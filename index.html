<h2><U>About ME</U></h2>
<p>Mind Empowered is a charitable trust dedicated to improving the mental health and well-being of individuals in India. The trust was founded in 2018 by a group of mental health professionals who recognized the need for accessible and affordable mental health care in the country. Mind Empowered's mission is to promote mental health awareness, provide counseling and therapy services, and advocate for policies that support mental health care in India.</p>

<p>One of Mind Empowered's primary objectives is to increase mental health literacy in India. The trust offers a variety of educational programs and workshops to raise awareness and reduce stigma surrounding mental health issues. These programs are designed for different audiences, including schools, colleges, and workplaces. The goal is to equip people with the knowledge and skills to recognize and manage their own mental health and to support others who may be struggling.</p>

<p>In addition to mental health education, Mind Empowered provides counseling and therapy services to individuals in need. The trust has a team of trained mental health professionals who offer counseling and therapy services both in-person and online. These services are affordable and accessible to people from all walks of life, including those who may not have the means to access private mental health care. Mind Empowered also offers support groups for individuals with specific mental health concerns, such as depression, anxiety, and addiction</p>
